Would you, could you in a house
Would you, could you with a mouse
Would you, could you in a box
Would you, could you with a fox
Would you like green eggs and ham?
Would you like them, Sam I Am?
Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full:
One for my master, one for my dame,
And one for the little boy that lives in our lane.
Baa, baa, black sheep, have you any wool?
Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bags full.
